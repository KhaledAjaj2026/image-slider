# Image Slider

A basic JS app that cycles through a group of images using on-screen arrows.

## Lessons Learned

Made entire app in single HTML file, using script tags and style tags to get everything done with the least clutter possible. Learned how to changed states between different elements and how to show/hide them upon clicking.

Refreshed my knowledge on fundamental web development concepts such as DOM manipulation and styling in vanilla CSS. Enjoyed the simplicity of the app, and quite like the idea of having everything in one file.

## Possible Future Updates

* Compress images to fit in the viewport and making them responsive.
* Animation of image sliding & fading to selected direction, then have next image fade in going same direction (i.e. click left = fade-out left, fade-in left).
* Transform project into a slider-creator, where a slider with user-inserted images is returned.
* Change HTML aspect of images into a JS array that takes an input of images to portray in slider.
